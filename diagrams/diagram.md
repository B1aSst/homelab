# Diagram

Dependings on the context, I use different tools to make diagrams :
- D2 for clean diagram
- Draw.io or Visio to create fast diagram in GUI

## D2

I use [D2](https://d2lang.com/) to create diagrams. It's clean and easy to use.

To try it out online: [Playground](https://play.d2lang.com/)

### Installation

[Install D2](https://d2lang.com/tour/install/)

To compile on save and serve the output on a local HTTP port:
```sh
d2 --watch my-diagram.d2
```

To format file:
```sh
d2 fmt my-diagram.d2
```

You can also launch the playground with your file from CLI:
```sh
d2 play my-diagram.d2
```

Some libraries for icons:
- [terrastruct](https://icons.terrastruct.com/)
- [homelab-svg-assets](https://github.com/loganmarchione/homelab-svg-assets?tab=readme-ov-file)
